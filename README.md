**Expert Finder App**
Welcome to the Expert Finder app! This app provides easy online booking for a variety of on-demand services such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, gas engineers, cleaners, painters, builders, and personal care services. With Expert Finder, you can conveniently connect with skilled workers in the UK's three largest cities: London, Birmingham, and Manchester. Say goodbye to the hassle of finding reliable service providers and save both time and money.

**Description**
Expert Finder is a multifunctional app designed to simplify the process of booking different services. Whether you need a quick fix or a major repair, this app has got you covered. It offers a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience for users looking to hire skilled workers. The app is compatible with Android devices running on Android 8.0 and above.

**Design & Features**
We have made significant improvements to the initial prototype of Expert Finder, focusing on enhancing the user interface and adding new features to improve functionality. Let's explore the key aspects of the app.

**Updated Design**
We have revamped the UI design to provide a visually appealing and intuitive experience for users. We understand that the interface is the first point of interaction, and we strive to make it as pleasant as possible. The updated design includes additional activities and navigation options for improved functionality, such as worker details and order details.

Furthermore, we have introduced a chat request feature that allows customers to initiate a conversation with the worker. However, we have also taken into consideration the worker's schedule and provided them with the option to accept or reject the chat request. Additionally, we have included an email feature to facilitate communication between customers and workers. This allows them to discuss task-related queries before and after placing an order.

**Implemented Features**
Expert Finder already offers a range of implemented features that are ready for use upon the application's launch. Let's take a look at some of these features:

**Register as a Worker:** Every new worker must register as a worker to use the application.

**Register as a Customer:** Every new customer must register as a customer to use the application.

**User Login:** Existing users can log in to the app as either a customer or a worker.

**Checkout Available Services:** Once authenticated, users can view the available services.

**Available Workers:** Customers can see a list of available workers based on their requirements.

**Booked Worker:** Customers can book workers for their tasks after visiting their profiles. They will receive a notification confirming the booking.

**Order Detail:** Customers can view the details of their booked orders.

**Worker Detail:** Customers can browse through a list of workers and view their profiles.

**Email to Worker:** Customers can send emails to workers regarding task details and availability. The email application will launch for composing the message.


**Up comming Features**
We are continuously working on enhancing Expert Finder, and the following features are currently in the development phase:

Feedback to Worker: After the completion of a task, customers will have the option to provide feedback on the worker's performance. This feature is almost complete but undergoing testing by the Quality Assurance team.

Chat Between Customer and Worker: In addition to email communication, we are implementing a chat functionality using the MirrorFly Chat SDK. This will enable real-time communication between customers and workers. Integration with the chat server is the most challenging aspect of this feature.

Location Services: Customers will be able to view available workers for specific services in their area. We will be using the Android Map SDK to display nearby workers on a map based on the customer's location.

Thank you for choosing Expert Finder! We aim to simplify your search for skilled workers and make your life easier. Stay tuned for future updates and enjoy hassle-free booking with our app.
