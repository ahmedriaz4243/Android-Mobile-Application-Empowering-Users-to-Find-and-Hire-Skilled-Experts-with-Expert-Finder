**Description**
Expert Finder is a multifunctional app designed to simplify the process of booking different services. Whether you need a quick fix or a major repair, this app has got you covered. It offers a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience for users looking to hire skilled workers. The app is compatible with Android devices running on Android 8.0 and above.

**Design & Features**
We have made significant improvements to the initial prototype of Expert Finder, focusing on enhancing the user interface and adding new features to improve functionality. Let's explore the key aspects of the app.

Updated Design
We have revamped the UI design to provide a visually appealing and intuitive experience for users. We understand that the interface is the first point of interaction, and we strive to make it as pleasant as possible. The updated design includes additional activities and navigation options for improved functionality, such as worker details and order details.

Furthermore, we have introduced a chat request feature that allows customers to initiate a conversation with the worker. However, we have also taken into consideration the worker's schedule and provided them with the option to accept or reject the chat request. Additionally, we have included an email feature to facilitate communication between customers and workers. This allows them to discuss task-related queries before and after placing an order.

**Implemented Features**
Expert Finder already offers a range of implemented features that are ready for use upon the application's launch. Let's take a look at some of these features:

**1.** Register as a Worker
To utilize the application as a worker, it is mandatory to register and create a worker profile. This ensures that only skilled workers are available for customers to hire.

**2.** Register as a Customer
To access the full functionality of the app as a customer, registration is required. By registering as a customer, you can take advantage of all the features and services offered by Expert Finder.

**3.** User Login
For existing users, simply log in to the app as either a customer or a worker. This allows you to access your profile, manage bookings, and enjoy a personalized experience within the app.

We are continuously working to enhance Expert Finder, and several exciting features are currently in the development phase. These features will be included in the next release cycle, providing even more convenience and value to our users.
